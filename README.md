# FPGAD Dodge Snowball Game (Completed Dec. 2018)

"Dodge Snowball" is a two player game where one player tries to dodge snowballs on a screen while the other player swaps them. The game was written by a team of two with SystemVerilog for the DE1-SoC FPGA and was displayed over VGA. We also used a camera to set the color of the snowballs on screen as the average color that the camera sees.

Although we were not able to track the snowballs moving accross the screen perfectly, we both gained experience working with VGA output and camera input to a FPGA.
